# *Scan F*
## What is **scanf**?
'scanf' is a function in the C programming language that is used to read input from the user. It allows you to specify the type of data you're expecting, such as an *integer (%d), a character (%c), or a string (%s),* among others. It's important to note that when using scanf, you need to provide the address of the variable where the input will be stored, which is typically done using the & operator before the variable name.

## If **`float`** is given
If you want to read a float value from the user using scanf, you can use the 
**%f** format specifier. Here's a brief example:
```c
float number;
scanf("%f", &number);
```

In this code, scanf will wait for the user to input a float value, and then it will store that value in the number variable.

## Different Formats:
### 1.Using `int` variable:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("The given number is %d.\n", n);
}
```
### 2.Using `char` variable:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    char s[10];
    scanf("%s", s);
    printf("Hi my name is %s.\n", s);
}
```
**Note**:In C, the name of an array is essentially a pointer to the first element of the array. So when you're using `scanf` with a string (which is an array of characters), you don't need to use the `&` operator because the string name `s` is already a pointer. The `&` operator is used to get the address of a variable, but since s is already an address (the start of your array), you don't need `&`.

### 3.Using `float` variable :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    float n;
    scanf("%f", &n);
    printf("%f", n);
    
}
```
## Example :
### 1.Printing sum of two numbers:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int a, b, sum;
    scanf(" %d", &a);
    scanf(" %d", &b);
    sum = a + b;
    printf("%d", sum);

}
```
