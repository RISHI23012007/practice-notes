# **_Division Of Numbers_**
## This code for dividing two numbers:
```c

#include<cs50.h>
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int num1;
    int num2;
    int quotient;
    int remainder;

    printf("To get quotient and remainder a  \n");
    num1 = get_int ("Enter 1st number: ");
    num2 = get_int ("Enter 2nd number : ");
    quotient = num1 / num2;
    remainder = num1 % num2;
    printf(" The quotient of %i and %i when divided is %i.The remainder of %i and %i when divided is %i \n",num1,num2,quotient,num1,num2,remainder);
}
```
## Output:
To get quotient and remainder  
Enter 1st number: 50

Enter 2nd number : 7

 The quotient of 50 and 7 when divided is 7
 
 The remainder of 50 and 7 when divided is 1
