# For Loop:
## **Duck Debugger Q&A**:


### Question 1: What is **for** loop?
### Answer :
#### A **for** loop is a control flow statement in programming that allows code to be executed repeatedly. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's a basic structure in C:
```c
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to be executed
}
```

#### Initialization is where you set your loop variable initially. The condition is checked before each iteration, and the loop continues as long as this condition is true. The increment/decrement part updates the loop variable after each iteration.

### Question 2: What is difference between a **For** loop and *While* loop?
### Answer :
#### The main difference between a **for** loop and a *while* loop lies in their structure and how they handle the loop control variables.A for loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to iterate. 
#### It includes initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in its syntax.
#### On the other hand, a while loop is generally used when you want to iterate based on a condition, and you don't necessarily know how many times you'll need to loop. 
#### The loop continues as long as the condition is true.
 #### The initialization and increment/decrement of the control variable are usually handled inside the loop body or before the loop starts.
#### Remember, both can be used interchangeably, but choosing the right one can make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

### Question 3:An example of simple **For loop**.
### Answer 
#### Sure, here's a simple example of a for loop in C that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:
```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```
#### In this example, i is initialized to 1. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5. After each iteration, i is incremented by 1. The printf function inside the loop prints the current value of `i

### Question 4 : Where is **For** loop used?
### Answer :
#### A *for* loop is used in programming when you need to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. It's commonly used in scenarios where the number of iterations is known in advance. Here are a few examples:

#### 1.Iterating over arrays or lists: If you have a list of items and you want to perform an operation on each item, you can use a for loop.

#### 2.Counting: If you need to count from one number to another, or count the number of times a certain condition is met, a for loop can be used.

#### 3.Repetitive operations: If you need to perform the same operation multiple times, such as generating a series of numbers or characters, a for loop can be useful.

#### Remember, the use of for loops is not limited to these examples. Any situation where you need to repeat a task a specific number of times can potentially use a for loop.


## **Debug and Screen Record**:

## **For Loop** used to find numbers from 0 to entered number. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n, i = 0 ;
     n = get_int("Enter upto which number you need : ");

    for (i = 0 ;i <= n; i++)
    {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
}
```
